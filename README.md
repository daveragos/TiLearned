# TiLearned

TiLearned is a repository dedicated to documenting my daily learnings in the field of software development. Whether it's mastering a new programming concept, exploring a new technology, or honing soft skills, this repository serves as a personal knowledge base to track my growth and progress over time.

## Motivation

The primary goal of TiLearned is to foster a habit of continuous learning and reflection. By logging my daily learnings, I aim to:

- **Track Progress:** Documenting each day's learnings allows me to track my progress and accomplishments over time.
- **Reflect and Review:** Reviewing past entries helps me reflect on what I've learned, reinforce concepts, and identify areas for improvement.
- **Share and Collaborate:** Making my learnings public encourages collaboration, feedback, and knowledge sharing with others in the community.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders to categorize different types of learnings:

- **Programming Languages:** Contains subfolders for each programming language I explore, along with code snippets, notes, and resources related to those languages.
- **Frameworks and Technologies:** Dedicated to various frameworks, libraries, tools, or technologies I delve into.
- **Soft Skills:** Focuses on improving soft skills such as communication, time management, problem-solving, etc.
- **Projects:** Documents personal projects, including ideas, planning documents, progress updates, and lessons learned.
- **Miscellaneous:** For topics that don't fit neatly into other categories, including random thoughts, interesting articles, or anything else worth noting.

## Daily Logs

Each day, I create a new file or folder to log my learnings for that day. These entries include:

- **Date:** The date of the entry for easy chronological tracking.
- **Learnings:** A summary of what I learned that day, including programming concepts, coding challenges, soft skills practiced, insights from articles or tutorials, project progress, etc.

<!-- ## Automation

To streamline the logging process, I've automated parts of the workflow, including:

- **Daily Log Generation:** A script generates a new markdown file each day for logging learnings, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
- **Commit Automation:** Commits and pushes daily log entries to this repository automatically, reducing manual effort.
- **Integration with Task Managers:** Integrated with task managers or calendars to prompt and remind me to log daily learnings. -->

## Contributions

I encourage contributions, feedback, and discussions from the community. If you find value in this repository or have insights to share, feel free to:

- Open issues to suggest improvements, report bugs, or discuss ideas.
- Submit pull requests to contribute code snippets, resources, or suggestions for enhancing the repository.

Let's learn and grow together!
