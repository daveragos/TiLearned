#### FizzBuzz in Python

```python
# FizzBuzz implementation in Python
def fizzbuzz(n):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)

fizzbuzz(15)
```

#### Sorting Algorithm in Java

```java
// Sorting algorithm implementation in Java
public class BubbleSort {
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                    // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                    arr[j+1] = temp;
                }
            }
